![media-servarr](./icon.png)

A collection of Helm charts for self-hosted media - primarily built around the [Servarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/) family of charts, with some complementary charts here and there.

All charts share the common base (`media-servarr-base`) so configuration patterns are consistent across every application.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes `>=1.24`
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) `>=3.12`
- (Optional) [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) CRDs if enabling `metrics` where available (see [exportarr](https://github.com/onedr0p/exportarr))

## Usage

Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add media-servarr https://media-servarr.shw.al/charts
helm repo update
```

List available charts:

```bash
helm search repo media-servarr
```

Install a chart (Sonarr as an example):

```bash
helm install sonarr media-servarr/sonarr -f my-values.yaml
```

Upgrade an existing release:

```bash
helm upgrade sonarr media-servarr/sonarr -f my-values.yaml
```

## Configuration

The `media-servarr-base` library gives every chart the same building blocks: secret injection (inline or by reference), config-as-code via a ConfigMap-mounted config file, declarative PersistentVolumeClaims (including binding to a pre-existing PV via `volumeName`), ingress with optional TLS, an optional [Exportarr](https://github.com/onedr0p/exportarr) metrics sidecar for the *arr apps, and the usual pod-scheduling knobs.

For the full list of value keys, their types, and inline documentation:

- **Per-chart guides** — each chart has its own [`README.md`](./charts) with an installation walkthrough and worked examples.
- **JSON Schema** — [`values.schema.json`](./values.schema.json) validates every value path. Editors with the [YAML Language Server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) pick it up automatically via the modeline at the top of each `values.yaml`.
- **Default values** — [`values.yaml`](./values.yaml) is the canonical reference for defaults and shape.

A distinctive pattern used in these charts is the **config-as-code with secret substitution**: application config lives in `values.yaml`, gets rendered to a ConfigMap, and secrets are substituted at pod start, allowing use to use secrets and configmap without having to commit their values:

```yaml
secrets:
  - name: apiKey
    ref: 'my-api-key'

application:
  config:
    filename: config.xml
    mountPath: /config/config.xml
    secrets: [apiKey]        # substituted as $apiKey in contents
    contents: |
      <Config>
        <ApiKey>$apiKey</ApiKey>
      </Config>
```
