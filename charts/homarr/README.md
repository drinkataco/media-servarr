## Installation

Install this helm chart using the following command:

```bash
helm repo add mediar-servarr https://media-servarr.shw.al/charts

helm install homarr media-servarr/homarr
```

Pointing the host `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes cluster will then allow you to access the application at the default location of `http://media-servarr.local/homarr/`

## Configuration

Here is some example of some configuration you may want to override (and include in installation with `-f myvalues.yaml`

### Application Configuration

You can change the default port in the application config

```yaml
application:
  port: 7575
```

### Volumes

Three volumes are available by default:

- **app-data-configs** - Dashboard files
- **data** - Homarr data
- **app-data-icons** - Icons

```yaml
deployment:
  ...
  volumes:
    # Dashboard (config) files
    app-data-configs:
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        name: 'my-pv-claim1'
      emptyDir: # nullify default empty dir
    # Dashboard Icons
    app-data-icons:
      # Example direct NFS mount without need for PV
      nfs:
        server: 'fileserver'
        path: '/srv/homarr/icons'
      emptyDir: # nullify default empty dir
```

By default, a PersistentVolumeClaim will be provisioned for all the config directories listed above

You can define basic persistent volume claims in code to help you get started. You just need to pass to the pvc name (which is the key) is an empty object (`{}`)

```yaml
persistentVolumeClaims:
  # Default PV is for 'data' where the SQlite database exists
  data:
    accessMode: 'ReadWriteOnce'
    requestStorage: '1Gi'
    storageClassName: 'manual'
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        type: 'local'
```

### Ingress

Ingress can be enabled, and you can customise the default host, path, and TLS settings:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: 'example.com'
  tls:
    # Your TLS settings...
```

### Advanced

Other supported deployment configuration include `deployment.nodeSelector`, `deployment.tolerations`, and `deployment.affinity`

You can also adjust container ports, environment variables (such as adding `PGID` and `PUID`) and define a `serviceAccount`.

Have a look at the parent charts default `values.yaml` for a comprehensive list of available config.

## Upgrading

To upgrade the deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade homarr media-servarr/homarr -f myvalues.yaml
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `homarr` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall homarr
```
