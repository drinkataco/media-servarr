## Installation

Install this helm chart using the following command:

```bash
helm repo add mediar-servarr https://media-servarr.shw.al/charts

helm install jellyfin media-servarr/jellyfin
```

Pointing the host `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes cluster will then allow you to access the application at the default location of `http://media-servarr.local/jellyfin/`

## Configuration

Here is some example of some configuration you may want to override (and include in installation with `-f myvalues.yaml`

### Application Configuration

By default, base configuration is defined using a ConfigMap - defined by default in `./values.yaml` in `application.config`. You can change values in the contents, such as the url base in your custom `values.yaml`

Jellyfin has multiple config files which we can create ConfigMaps for. By default, we manage network.xml and system.xml, but we could also encoding.xml.

```yaml
application:
  port: 8096 # default UI port
  urlBase: 'jellyfin' # default web base path
  config:
    - filename: 'network.xml'
      contents: |
        # We could change the BaseURL or Port here
        ...
      mountPath: '/config/config/network.xml'
    # System Options
    - filename: 'system.xml'
      contents: |
        # We could add <EnableMetrics>true</EnableMetrics> to enable prometheus metrics
        # It is recommended to add <IsStartupWizardCompleted>true</IsStartupWizardCompleted> to
        #  prevent the wizard running again after initial setup.
        ...
      mountPath: '/config/config/system.xml'
    - filename: 'encoding.xml'
      contents: |
        ...
      mountPath: '/config/config/encoding.xml'
```

You can prevent a ConfigMap being create and the configuration being managed as a kubernetes resource by defing the config as null. For example;

```yaml
application:
  ...
  config: null
```

### Volumes

The following volumes are available by default:

- **config** - General config data, where the sqlite database exists, for example
- **ebooks** - Location of ebooks
- **film** - Location of movies
- **music** - Location of music
- **television** - Location of TV shows

```yaml
deployment:
  ...
  volumes:
    config: # The key will be the volume name
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        name: 'jellyfin-config'
    ebooks:
      nfs:
        server: 'fileserver.local'
        path: '/srv/media/ebooks/'
    film:
    music:
    television:
```

By default, a PersistentVolumeClaim will be provisioned for the `config`, but `emptyDir: {}` will be used for ebooks, film, music, and television, unless otherwise specified in your `values.yaml`

```yaml
persistentVolumeClaims:
  jellyfin-config:
    accessMode: 'ReadWriteOnce'
    requestStorage: '1Gi'
    storageClassName: 'manual'
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        type: 'local'
```

### Ingress

Ingress can be enabled, and you can customise the default host, path, and TLS settings:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: 'example.com'
  tls:
    # Your TLS settings...
```

### Metrics

Prometheus metrics are enabled by placing `<EnableMetrics>true</EnableMetrics>` in System.xml.

Read more about this functionality in the [official documentation](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/networking/monitoring/)

### Hardware Acceleration for Transcoding

If your cluster supports GPUs, you can use `runtimeClassName` to ensure you are using the correct runtime class, be sure `nodeSelector` to control app placement. You should review the [official documentation](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/post-install/transcoding/hardware-acceleration/) to understand how the official docker image supports hardware acceleration for your hardware type, and review the docs for enabling hardware passthrough on your kubernetes cluster.

### Advanced

Other supported deployment configuration include `deployment.nodeSelector`, `deployment.tolerations`, and `deployment.affinity`

You can also adjust container ports, environment variables (such as adding `PGID` and `PUID`) and define a `serviceAccount`.

Have a look at the parent charts default `values.yaml` for a comprehensive list of available config.

## Upgrading

To upgrade the deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade jellyfin media-servarr/jellyfin -f myvalues.yaml
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `jellyfin` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall jellyfin
```

## Support

For support, issues, or feature requests, please file an issue on the chart's repository issue tracker.
