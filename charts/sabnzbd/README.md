## Installation

Install this helm chart using the following command:

```bash
helm repo add mediar-servarr https://media-servarr.shw.al/charts

helm install sabnzbd media-servarr/sabnzbd
```

Pointing the host `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes cluster will then allow you to access the application at the default location of `http://media-servarr.local/sabnzbd/`

## Configuration

Here is some example of some configuration you may want to override (and include in installation with `-f myvalues.yaml`

### Secrets

To set up secrets, like API keys, use the following format. Use `openssl rand -hex 16` to generate a key and replace the default value.

```yaml
secrets:
  - name: 'apiKey'
    value: 'apiKey'
  - name: 'nzbKey'
    value: 'nzbKey'
  # - name: 'newsreaderServerPassword'
  #   value: 'password123'
```

If setting up a ConfigMap, you can also store any newsreader server passwords here, for example

### Application Configuration

By default, base configuration is defined using a ConfigMap - defined by default in `./values.yaml` in `application.config`.

You can also add servers here, as shown under the `[servers]` block

```yaml
application:
  port: 8080 # default UI port
  urlBase: 'sabnzbd' # default web base path
  config:
    contents: |
      [misc]
      language = en
      queue_limit = 20
      port = 8080
      api_key = $apiKey
      nzb_key = $nzbKey
      download_dir = Downloads/incomplete
      complete_dir = Downloads/complete
      # [servers]
      # [[yournewsreader.example.org]]
      # name = yournewsreader.example.org
      # displayname = yourNewsReader
      # host = yournewsreader.example.org
      # port = 563
      # username = username
      # password = $newsreaderServerPassword
      # connections = 8
      # ssl = 1
      # ssl_verify = 2
      # enable = 1
      # priority = 0
```

You can prevent a ConfigMap being create and the configuration being managed as a kubernetes resource by defing the config as null. For example;

```yaml
application:
  ...
  config: null
```

### Volumes

Three volumes are available by default:

- **config** - General config data
- **downloads** - Downloads folder, with {complete, incomplete} subdirectories

```yaml
deployment:
  ...
  volumes:
    config: # The key will be the volume name
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        name: 'sabnzbd-config'
    downloads:
      nfs:
        server: 'fileserver.local'
        path: '/srv/downloads/'
```

By default, a PersistentVolumeClaim will be provisioned for the `config`, but `emptyDir: {}` will be used for downloads - but it is recommended enable some type of PVC and PV!

You can define basic persistent volume claims in code to help you get started. You just need to pass to the pvc name (which is the key) is an empty object (`{}`)

```yaml
persistentVolumeClaims:
  sabnzbd-config:
    accessMode: 'ReadWriteOnce'
    requestStorage: '1Gi'
    storageClassName: 'manual'
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        type: 'local'
```

### Ingress

Ingress can be enabled, and you can customise the default host, path, and TLS settings:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: 'example.com'
  tls:
    # Your TLS settings...
```

### Metrics

Enabling metrics enables a sidecar container being attached for [exportarr](https://github.com/onedr0p/exportarr/) - and a ServiceMonitor CRD to be consumed by the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) package.

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true
  env: []
```

It is recommended to install [kube-prometheus chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) first for the CRD to be supported. It is not included as a dependency by default in this package!

Unless changed with `metrics.port.number` you can then consume metrics over port `9707`.

### Advanced

Other supported deployment configuration include `deployment.nodeSelector`, `deployment.tolerations`, and `deployment.affinity`

You can also adjust container ports, environment variables (such as adding `PGID` and `PUID`) and define a `serviceAccount`.

Have a look at the parent charts default `values.yaml` for a comprehensive list of available config.

## Upgrading

To upgrade the deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade sabnzbd media-servarr/sabnzbd -f myvalues.yaml
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `sabnzbd` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall sabnzbd
```
