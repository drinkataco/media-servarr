# Bazarr Helm Chart

This Helm chart installs Bazarr, a companion application for [Radarr](../radarr/) and [Sonarr](../sonarr/) to manage and download subtitles

This README covers the basics of customising and installation

## Installation

Install this helm chart using the following command:

```bash
helm repo add mediar-servarr https://media-servarr.shw.al/charts

helm install bazarr media-servarr/bazarr
```

Pointing the host `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes cluster will then allow you to access the application at the default location of `http://media-servarr.local/bazarr/`

## Configuration

Here is some example of some configuration you may want to override (and include in installation with `-f myvalues.yaml`

### Secrets

To set up secrets, like API keys, use the following format.

Use `openssl rand -hex 16` to generate a key and replace the default value. If using a ConfigMap to manage configuration, you can also set various other secrets here too - such as service passwords, or sonarr and radarr API keys.

```yaml
secrets:
  - name: 'apiKey'
    value: 'your-api-key-here'
  - name: 'sonarrApiKey'
    value: ''
  - name: 'radarrApiKey'
    value: ''
```

By not setting this value, and leaving it blank, Bazarr will automatically generate a new key on start.

### Application Configuration

By default, base configuration is defined using a ConfigMap - defined by default in `./values.yaml` in `application.config`. You can change values in the contents, such as the url base in your custom `values.yaml`.

The list of configurable items is extensive. You can configure service providers directly here, for example. Only a selection of core settings are included in the existing ConfigMap in [values.yaml](values.yaml) - But an exhaustive list is included in [config.example.yaml](./config.example.yaml)

The following example expects to have secrets set up for Radarr and Sonarr API keys for secret injection:

```yaml
application:
  port: 8686 # default UI port
  urlBase: 'radarr' # default web base path
  config:
    contents: |
      general:
        adaptive_searching: true
        auto_update: false
        base_url: '/bazarr'
        port: 6767
        use_radarr: false
        use_sonarr: false
        radarr:
          apiKey: '$radarrApiKey'
          base_url: '/radarr'
          ip: 'radarr.media-servarr.svc.cluster.local'
          port: 7878
        sonarr:
          apiKey: '$sonarrApiKey'
          base_url: '/sonarr'
          ip: 'sonarr.media-servarr.svc.cluster.local'
          port: 8989
    # Secrets to inject the config they must be defined as $secret
    secrets:
      - 'apiKey'
      - 'sonarrApiKey'
      - 'radarrApiKey'
```

You can prevent a ConfigMap being create and the configuration being managed as a kubernetes resource by defing the config as null. For example;

```yaml
application:
  ...
  config: null
```

### Volumes

A volume is included just for configuration:

- **config** - General config data, where the sqlite database exists, for example

```yaml
deployment:
  ...
  volumes:
    config: # The key will be the volume name
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        name: 'bazarr-config'
```

By default, a PersistentVolumeClaim will be provisioned for the `config` named `bazarr-config`.

```yaml
persistentVolumeClaims:
  bazarr-config:
    accessMode: 'ReadWriteOnce'
    requestStorage: '1Gi'
    storageClassName: 'manual'
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        type: 'local'
```

### Ingress

Ingress can be enabled, and you can customise the default host, path, and TLS settings:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: 'example.com'
  tls:
    # Your TLS settings...
```

### Metrics

Enabling metrics enables a sidecar container being attached for [exportarr](https://github.com/onedr0p/exportarr/) - and a ServiceMonitor CRD to be consumed by the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) package.

```yaml
metrics:
  enabled: true
  env: []
```

It is recommended to install [kube-prometheus chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) first for the CRD to be supported. It is not included as a dependency by default in this package!

Unless changed with `metrics.port.number` you can then consume metrics over port `9702`.

### Advanced

Other supported deployment configuration include `deployment.nodeSelector`, `deployment.tolerations`, and `deployment.affinity`

You can also adjust container ports, environment variables (such as adding `PGID` and `PUID`) and define a `serviceAccount`.

Have a look at the parent charts default `values.yaml` for a comprehensive list of available config.

## Upgrading

To upgrade the deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade bazarr media-servarr/bazarr -f myvalues.yaml
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `bazarr` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall bazarr
```
