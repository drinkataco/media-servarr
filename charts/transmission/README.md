## Installation

Install this helm chart using the following command:

```bash
helm repo add mediar-servarr https://media-servarr.shw.al/charts

helm install transmission media-servarr/transmission
```

Pointing the host `media-servarr.local` to your kubernetes cluster will then allow you to access the application at the default location of `http://media-servarr.local/transmission/`

## Configuration

Here is some example of some configuration you may want to override (and include in installation with `-f myvalues.yaml`

### Application Configuration

By default, base configuration is defined using a ConfigMap - defined by default in `./values.yaml` in `application.config`. You can change values in the contents, such as the url base in your custom `values.yaml`

```yaml
application:
  port: 9091 # default UI port
  urlBase: 'transmission' # default web base path
  config:
    filename: 'settings.json'
    contents: |
      {
        ...
        "rpcAuthentication": true,
        "rpcUsername": "username",
        ...
      }
    secrets: [ 'rpcPassword' ]
    mountPath: '/config/settings.json'
```

You can prevent a ConfigMap being create and the configuration being managed as a kubernetes resource by defing the config as null. For example;

```yaml
application:
  ...
  config: null
```

### Volumes

Three volumes are available by default:

- **config** - General config data - where settings exist
- **downloads** - Downloads folder

```yaml
deployment:
  ...
  volumes:
    config: # The key will be the volume name
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        name: 'transmission-config'
    downloads:
      nfs:
        server: 'fileserver.local'
        path: '/srv/downloads/'
```

By default, a PersistentVolumeClaim will be provisioned for the `config`, but `emptyDir: {}` will be used for downloads - but it is recommended enable some type of PVC and PV!

You can define basic persistent volume claims in code to help you get started. You just need to pass to the pvc name (which is the key) is an empty object (`{}`)

```yaml
persistentVolumeClaims:
  transmission-config:
    accessMode: 'ReadWriteOnce'
    requestStorage: '1Gi'
    storageClassName: 'manual'
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        type: 'local'
```

### Ingress Configuration

If ingress is enabled, you can customise the host, paths, and TLS settings:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
```

### Advanced

Other supported deployment configuration include `deployment.nodeSelector`, `deployment.tolerations`, and `deployment.affinity`

You can also adjust container ports, environment variables (such as adding `PGID` and `PUID`) and define a `serviceAccount`.

Have a look at the parent charts default `values.yaml` for a comprehensive list of available config.

## Upgrading

To upgrade the deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade transmission media-servarr/transmission -f myvalues.yaml
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `transmission` deployment:

```bash
helm delete transmission
```

## Support

For support, issues, or feature requests, please file an issue on the chart's repository issue tracker.
